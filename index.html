                <p style="font-size: 24px;color:black">A syringe pump is a small infusion pump that gradually administers small amounts of fluid.
                    A syringe pump follows the principle of the Archimedean screw. This allows the syringe to be pushed forwards depending on the value of pression and volumetric flow rate that was chosen beforehand. Also, this allows the inserted fluid to be injected at a constant rate for a certain time.
                    The most widespread use of syringe pumps is in palliative care. It administers analgesics such as painkillers, antiemetics and other drugs. This prevents medication levels in the blood from becoming too high or too low and allows us to avoid the consumption of multiple tablets. Syringe pumps can also be used to deliver IV medications over a certain time. Especially in the case of a medication that must be slowly inserted over the course of several minutes, this device saves staff time and reduces errors.

                    <h1 style="color: black; font-size: 50px;">Overview</h1><hr>
                    <p style="font-size: 24px;color:black">The goal of this project is to provide an open-source syringe pump that is easy to procure and assemble, significantly less expensive than commercial pumps, while maintaining a sufficient level of dispense precision and accuracy. It was developed in the Fablab in Electrical Engneering Block (III) Sukkur IBA University.

                        <h1 style="color: black; font-size: 50px;">Features</h1><hr>
                        <p style="font-size: 24px;color:black">A syringe pump is a motor-driven precision pump that uses one syringes to deliver precise and accurate amounts of fluid in high-impact research environments.

                        <h3 style="color: black; font-size: 35px;">Types of Syringe Pumps</h3><hr>
                        <p style="font-size: 24px;color:black">There are two broad types of pumps: Laboratory syringe pump and Medical infusion pump<br>
                          •	Laboratory Syringe Pump: They are devices used in research laboratories for applications that require very accurate fluid deliveries. Lab research pumps typically handle smaller volumes and offer additional features that medical pumps do not have. Such as infuse and withdraw syringe pump, multi syringes syringe pump. OEM module syringe pump and high-pressure syringe pump. The OEM module syringe pump and high-pressure syringe pump have been found useful in industrial applications recently.<br>
                          •	Medical Infusion Pump: They are devices used to deliver controlled quantities of fluids such as nutrients, drugs, and blood to patients. This type of infusion pump can be used for in vivo diagnosis, treatment, and research.<br>

                        </p>
                        <h3 style="color: black; font-size: 35px;">FabLab Syringe Pump Design and Features</h3><hr>
                        <p style="font-size: 24px;color:black">Syringe pump design according to the application. However, all lab syringe pumps consist of the following:
                          The motor drives the plate, pushing the plunger which ejects the fluid from the syringe. Continuous flow can be achieved by using pumps with two syringes, where one pulls liquid and the other pushes liquid.
                          Most modern syringe pumps can be programmed for higher accuracy and improved control, and some models can be connected to a computer to record the infusion history. Moreover, syringe pump systems that have adjustable syringe holders are more versatile in their applications.
                          In addition, some syringe pumps can have both infusion and withdrawal features. They can operate at very small volumetric flow rates (in the micro, nano, and pico ranges) while offering pulseless flow with very high precision in delivery.
                          Many parameters can be controlled in modern syringe pumps. For example, pressure control facilitates handling liquids with high viscosity or to introduce fluids under high pressure. 
                          
                          </p>  
                          <h3 style="color: black; font-size: 35px;">Uses and Functions</h3><hr> 
                          <p style="font-size: 24px;color:black">At the research lab, syringe pumps can be used in almost any application that involves precise metering, especially at the micro and nanoscale. They are used in many research fields as precise dosing systems, or to accurately deliver small quantities of reagents, mix minuscule volumes, and add traces of specific chemicals over the course of the experiment. Moreover, syringe pumps compatible with microfluidic applications are available in the market, which facilitates research in fields such as micro-environmental control. Microfluidic applications of syringe pumps have been increased dramatically in the vaccine research area. Syringe pumps can also facilitate precise infusion in medical and biological research; for instance, feeding small animals or delivering very small doses to specific sites in the brain in neuroscience research.
                            In industrial applications, syringe pumps can be used for scale-up, new material development, and materials characterization in chemical, pharmaceutical, catalysis, and materials science research. They can also play a major role in minimizing errors in the fields of microanalysis and instrumental analytics, such as mass spectrometry (MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
                            In conclusion, syringe pumps are useful for accelerating research and minimizing fluid delivery errors in many advanced research fields.

There were many resources on the internet that were available, but we have to first interfaces different components so we searched for their interfacing. "github" website was very helpful for providing information about open source syringe infusion pump.Furthermore, we use "ST7735" Arduino library for oled display and "axisjoystick" library for controlling joystick and "accelstepper" library for controlling stepper motor
Furthermore, from the below mentioned sites there were many useful codes and libraries were available. I have also included their links in the References. I have devoted this project for the open-source community. We are making the project files resource files freely available on our webpage.

                                 As a Student of Electrical Engneering in Sukkur IBA University we are in the 4th semester and offered a course (Introduction to Embedded System) so first we are provided with Components like Oled(for display) Joystick(for user input) and Stepper Motor(to rotate the threaded rod work as a linear Actuator) and Arduino Uno .Now further we discuss that when how manage the project as per requirement . Because we have to design a commercial grade Syringe infusion Pump .in the beginning we follow different sources but they are not related to our requirement because we have to make a compact and easy to handle device so we make our project with blend mixture of different unique ideas and resources.<br>

                                    A number of display devices like LEDs, 7-segments, character and graphic displays can be attached to microcontrollers to create an interface between the user and an electronic system for displaying data or controlling the system. Sometimes you may need to add colorful images or graphics to your project, thats why we choose the TFT Oled.

                                        TFT LCD is a variant of a liquid-crystal display (LCD) that uses thin-film-transistor (TFT) technology to improve image qualities such as addressability and contrast. In this tutorial we are going to show how to interface a 1.44″ TFT color display based on the ST7735 driver. It has 128*128 color pixels and can display full 16-bit color.The display uses 4-wire SPI to communicate and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer, it can be used with every kind of microcontroller.

                                                There are a number of libraries that have been developed to run the TFT ST7735 color display using Arduino but I found the Adafruit-ST7735-Library the best to use. Make sure you have this library installed in your IDE.<br> 
                                                Most TFT libraries have been programmed to support the following commands:



Before we can write our personal code we need to first test the display using the already made code examples from the installed library. This is done by going to File>Examples>Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library. Then you can select any of the examples and upload it to the setup to see if the display works fine.In the diagram below I have shown how to access the graphics test code.

In the first couple of day when we start designing pcb it is very difficult to route the connections becausew have to make a compact PCB as per desired requirement of different things like OLED Joystick stepper motor driver and Last But not the least our hardware. so with the passage of time we go through all these difficulties and now we are able to design even complex PCB.<br>

These results show no significant differences when compared with other commercially available pumps.<br>

                                                            The efficacy testing of the fablab developed syringe pump showed the accuracy to be within tolerance. Based on these findings, we believe that the fablab developed syringe pump is suitable for clinical use.

Although this journey was very hard but our hard work taught us many essential skills in this course. During this journey we have learned about different microcontrollers and their architecture. We have learned how to program a microcontroller. We have learned how to interface different components with it. To sum up this discussion we would like to include the following points. During our project, we have learned:
                                                                    •	How to choose the components that are suitable to our needs.

•	How to integrate components in a circuit.<br>

•	How to program a microcontroller to manage the components.<br>

•	How to use functions to manage our code efficiently.<br>

•	How to use interfacing protocols.<br>

•	How to use EAGLE to design a PCB.<br>

•	How to design an enclosure for a circuit using SOLIDWORKS.<br>

•	How to manage different components together in a complex circuit.<br>

•	How to troubleshoot.<br>

•	Learned about project management.<br>

But unfortunately at about 12:30 our atmega328p becomes hot when we connect our PCB with power supply we try our best but our atmega328p burnout so now we have only about 10 hours. We both group Member have to decide what to do. We told all the situation to Sir Muhammad Asim Ali Samejo.then we decided to print PCB again and continue till morning .from 3am onwards everyone left the fablab. at about 4am we encountered with a major issue that the final PCB doesn't work we try our best and find out that in PCB the Driver connections are short with ground.so we remove some solder and our PCB starts working.at about 5am we modify the remaining software and give it a final touch. at about 6am we assemble the hardware and inclosure and wiring and our project is ready at about 8am.
